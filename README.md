What I'm focusing on 👩‍💻:

Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in AI and machine learning, working on exciting projects ranging from sentiment analysis to implementing Transformer models.
I'm also exploring NLP applications, particularly in style transfer and emotion detection from speech.

Technical Interests 🔧:

I enjoy working with Python, Java, and leveraging frameworks and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn for machine learning applications.
Apart from AI, I have a keen interest in cloud technologies and have been exploring AWS and Azure for deploying scalable applications.

Collaborations and Community 🌍:

I'm part of 'Rewrite the Code,' a women’s organization dedicated to supporting women in technology.
I actively contribute to open-source projects and always look to collaborate on projects that are open to innovative approaches and solutions.

When I'm not coding 🌟:

I indulge in reading about the latest tech trends, and I'm an avid bachata dancer and chess player.
