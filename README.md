I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, with a solid background in Computer Science from my undergraduate studies. With about three years of experience in software development, I've honed my skills in testing and building reliable software and AI solutions.

What I'm focusing on 👩‍💻:

I'm deepening my AI and Machine Learning knowledge, working on exciting projects ranging from Sentiment Analysis to implementing Transformer models.
I'm also exploring NLP applications, particularly in style transfer and emotion detection from speech.

Technical Interests 🔧:

I enjoy working with Python, and Java, and leveraging frameworks and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn for Machine Learning applications.
Apart from AI, I have a keen interest in Cloud technologies and have been exploring AWS and Azure to deploy scalable applications.

Collaborations and Community 🌍:

I'm part of 'Rewriting the Code,' a women’s organization dedicated to supporting women in technology.
I actively contribute to open-source projects and always look to collaborate on projects that are open to innovative approaches and solutions.

When I'm not coding 🌟:

I indulge in reading about the latest tech trends, and I'm an avid bachata dancer and chess player.
